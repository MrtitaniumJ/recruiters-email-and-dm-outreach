## 2024-04-13 - Array Spread inside Hot Loops
**Learning:** In JavaScript, using the array spread operator (`[...arr1, ...arr2]`) inside a frequently called function (like `computeScore` for every connection) causes significant performance overhead due to repeated memory allocations and garbage collection.
**Action:** Always pre-combine arrays and hoist them to the module or class scope when the arrays are static and used in a hot loop.

## 2024-05-24 - Avoiding Higher-Order Array Methods in Hot Loops
**Learning:** Using array iteration methods like `some` and `reduce` in a hot path (such as executing an array of regexes against many strings in `outreachClassifier.js`) incurs significant overhead compared to simple `for` loops, due to anonymous function allocations and callback invocation costs.
**Action:** When working on classification or processing loops that iterate over thousands of objects per run, replace `some`, `reduce`, or `map` with standard `for` loops to minimize CPU cycles and memory allocations.

## 2026-05-03 - Array Definitions inside Evaluated Hot Paths
**Learning:** In Puppeteer's `page.evaluate` blocks, repeatedly instantiating static arrays or Regexes inside helper functions called from hot loops (like `querySelectorAll().forEach`) introduces measurable garbage collection and compilation overhead.
**Action:** Hoist these static array and Regex definitions to the top scope of the evaluate block to reuse instances.
